Quickstep
=========

Quickstep is a system-level test automation framework which provides the facility to write and execute automated tests on Nature products.  The term <i>system-level</i> refers to the fact that tests written in QuickStep use the product in the same way that a user would (e.g. through a browser or mobile device).
